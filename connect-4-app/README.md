## Overview
While attending General Assembly for Software Programing (Jan - Apr, 2021), I recreated a game on the web. I chose to develop and deploy Connect 4, a game that I have fond memories of playing with my Grandma when I was young.


## About the Game

1. Player 1 is red, and Player 2 is yellow.
2. Each player takes turns making a move. Player 1 starts first.
3. The first player to get four checkers in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the round. 
4. Players can keep playing rounds for as long as they want.


## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Google Fonts
* VS Code
* Utilized live prototyping for wireframing and design
* GoodNotes (for project planning)


## Features
* Scoreboard that keeps track of how many rounds each player has won
* An indicator that shows which player's turn it is
* Automatically changes checker colors to align with the current player's turn
* Allows the player to click on the column that they want to place their checker in
* Automatically scans for win conditions after each player makes a move
* A button to allow the players to restart the round
* A button to allow the players to start a new game/clear their current game

* Allow players to change their checker colors
* Automatically switch who goes first each round
* Allow a player to play against an AI
